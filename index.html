            Hello and thank you for visiting my website! My name is Malik Kouyate and welcome to my journey towards becoming a developer! Why a developer you may ask? Well,
            all my life I have always been intrigued by the process of having an idea and navigating the neccesary steps to realize it. This way of thinking has applied to
            various passions and projects; from various cardboard crafts to building up computers and bicycles this albeit vague notion remains pervasive in my day to day.
            With all of that being said, I have found that computer programming really checks all of the boxes. It seems that every idea can be turned into some sort of 
            program or utility through tinkering, solving, and exploring. Theres nothing more gratifying than cracking a difficult problem and to be able to do that as a 
            proffesion: tis the dream. Anyway, Thanks again for visiting my website! Fairly basic at the moment but I hope to spice it up as I learn more!
        </p>
